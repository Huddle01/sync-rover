# SyncRover ðŸ¤–

SyncRover is a modern web application that demonstrates real-time, remote control of a vehicle using keyboard commands. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for building interactive, multi-user experiences on the web.

The core real-time functionality is powered by the **Huddle01 SDK**, which enables seamless, low-latency data messaging between the host controller and all viewers.
